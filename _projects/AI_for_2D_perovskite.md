We built an AI-guided design workflow that discovers new organic spacers for 2D Dion–Jacobson perovskites by linking molecular fingerprints → frontier energies → band alignment.

DJ perovskites have huge potential, but nearly all known ones share the same band alignment type (Ia).
To unlock new optical and electronic behaviors, we need spacers that give rare alignments like Ib, IIa, IIb.
