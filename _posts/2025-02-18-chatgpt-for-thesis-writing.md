I’ve been using AI tools since the early days of ChatGPT. It’s become a staple in my workflow—replying to emails, revising my blog posts (yes, I asked ChatGPT to rewrite this in [Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com) style), and occasionally assisting with academic writing.

Lately, I’ve been knee-deep in writing my thesis. Naturally, I was curious about whether AI could speed up the process. A quick search led me to videos boasting claims like “Write Your Thesis in an Hour with ChatGPT!” Intrigued, I decided to put this to the test with my literature review chapter. Spoiler: it didn’t quite work out that way. Here’s my experience—what ChatGPT can and can’t do, and what I found most frustrating.

### The Hype vs. Reality: My ChatGPT Experiment
When I started drafting my introduction and literature review, I was feeling ambitious. Given my positive experience using ChatGPT for casual writing, I thought, *Surely, with AI, I can wrap this up in a week.*

I was wrong.

It didn’t take long to realize that my expectations were way too high. Asking ChatGPT to generate the text I envisioned didn’t work. The output wasn’t what I needed—it was generic, lacked depth, and, in some cases, simply inaccurate.

### What ChatGPT Can’t Do

ChatGPT does a decent job summarizing broad topics, but when it comes to crafting nuanced, well-argued discussions, things fall apart—especially in emerging research fields like mine. Here’s why:

- It can’t assess source credibility. AI doesn’t evaluate journal quality, author expertise, or methodological soundness. It just regurgitates information without judgment.

- It produces generic content. While ChatGPT can string together coherent paragraphs, they often feel inflated with unnecessary filler. It lacks the precision and depth required for academic writing.

- It struggles with specialized arguments. A PhD thesis requires carefully crafted arguments built from deep domain knowledge. AI can’t replicate that.

- It doesn’t know what’s missing. The best research writing highlights gaps in the literature and positions the author’s work within that context. ChatGPT won’t instinctively identify these gaps—it takes human expertise.

For these reasons, I found myself frequently rewriting AI-generated text, replacing its vague statements with specific arguments backed by solid evidence.

### What ChatGPT Can Do

Despite its limitations, I have to admit—ChatGPT did help. A lot.

I finished my literature review in about two weeks, which, for me, is fast. While it didn’t “write my thesis in an hour,” it made the process more manageable. Here’s how:

- Outlining: ChatGPT is excellent at generating structured outlines. Even if I didn’t use its wording, seeing an initial structure helped me get started.

- Revising: It was invaluable for refining clunky first drafts. I often fed it my messy writing and prompted it with something like, “You are an experienced materials scientist who publishes in Nature and Science. Can you refine this paragraph?” The improvements were often significant.

- Polishing: AI helped clean up grammar, fix awkward phrasing, and improve readability—saving my supervisor from having to wade through unnecessary errors.

### Is Using AI for Thesis Writing Ethical?

The ethics of AI in academia is a hot topic. Some researchers—especially those from the old school—oppose AI use, even banning their PhD students from using ChatGPT.

Here’s my take: It depends on how you use it.

A PhD thesis isn’t an undergraduate essay; it’s about generating original, creative ideas. ChatGPT can’t do that. It doesn’t matter if OpenAI claims its new models have “PhD-level intelligence”—AI still lacks true academic insight. And honestly, reviewers can spot AI-generated fluff from a mile away. No serious researcher would risk using it that way.

That said, AI can be a fantastic tool for improving clarity and coherence. It speeds up the writing process without compromising originality. Current university and journal guidelines don’t strictly prohibit AI use in writing, but transparency is key—it’s good practice to acknowledge how ChatGPT was used in the process.

### My Key Takeaways for Using AI in Academic Writing

1. **Don’t Be Afraid to Revise Multiple Times.** A friend in computer science gave me great advice: *Treat ChatGPT like a human assistant.* Don’t accept its first draft—keep iterating until you get something useful.

2. **Master the Art of Prompting.** Better prompts lead to better results. Be specific. 
Instead of *“Summarize my thesis chapter,”* try *“Summarize the key findings of my thesis chapter on [topic] in a structured, concise manner.”* 
If writing a figure caption, don’t just ask *“Write a caption for this figure”*—be precise: *“Write a Nature-style caption explaining the key results and their significance in materials science.”*

### So, Does ChatGPT Help?

Absolutely. AI tools like ChatGPT are becoming as standard in academic writing as word processors once were. For me, it’s been a game-changer—saving time, improving clarity, and making revision less painful. But without original scientific ideas, ChatGPT is useless.

My supervisor is quite supportive of AI use, too. It saves him from fixing basic grammar mistakes, so he can focus on critiquing my arguments and ideas instead.

AI tools are evolving rapidly. With new models like DeepSeek, everyone is still figuring out how to make the most of them. I’m still learning myself—sometimes I get great results from ChatGPT, other times I struggle to replicate them.

Maybe in the future, every researcher will have their own personalized AI assistant, trained on their EndNote library, capable of summarizing and synthesizing papers on demand. With the explosion of scientific research, AI could become an essential tool for managing the overwhelming flood of information.

For now, though? AI can’t write your thesis in an hour. But it can definitely make the process a little less painful.
