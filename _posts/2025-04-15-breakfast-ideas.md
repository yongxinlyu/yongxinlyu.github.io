Mornings in our household are often a rush. My husband is also my breakfast partner, and neither of us likes to spend too much time preparing breakfast, and options outside are usually disappointing—pastries are too sweet, and bacon-and-egg rolls are often too salty or greasy.

We do have some go-to quick fixes: he can survive on hard-boiled eggs, and I used to get by with just a cup of coffee. Bananas and microwaved corn are also reliable choices. But over time, we’ve found a few breakfast recipes that take just a little more effort—and are totally worth it. These three are our favorites: quick, satisfying, and most importantly, we both genuinely enjoy them.

### 1. Avocado Toast

Avocado toast is a brunch staple in Sydney cafes, but it’s surprisingly easy (and rewarding) to make at home. When I first started making it, I used regular sliced bread—because, you know, sourdough isn’t that common in many Asian countries, and it took me a while to acquire a taste for it. But no one told me: for great avocado toast, **sourdough is everything**!

It’s been a steep learning curve figuring out how to choose, store, and prepare sourdough properly. Recently, I’ve found that the best way to serve it is to freeze the slices, briefly wet them, then toast them in an air fryer or oven. This method keeps the inside soft while preventing the crust from becoming too crispy—just the way we like it.

**What you’ll need for 2 people:**

- 3 slices sourdough (we love [soy and linseed sourdough from Harry’s Farm](https://www.harrisfarm.com.au/collections/sourdough/products/bowan-island-bread-sourdough-soy-linseed-half-loaf-20346))  
- 1 large avocado  
- 3 eggs  


**Assembly:**

1. Lay out the sourdough slices.  
2. Smash the avocado (I do it directly in its shell), then spread it over the bread.  
3. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.  
4. Scramble the eggs and layer them on top.  
5. Finish with another touch of salt and pepper.

**Toppings:**  
I like mine with a little kick—my favorite is [Brazilian pimenta hot sauce](https://brazilianstyle.com.au/collections/sauces/products/hot-red-pepper-sauce-molho-de-pimenta-vermelha-extra-forte-60ml) (though it’s hard to find), or [Tabasco](https://www.coles.com.au/product/mc-ilhenny-co.-tabasco-sauce-60ml-422599?uztq=46abcbb7e16253b0cdc3e6c5bbe6a3f0&srsltid=AfmBOoq9H3ko0CfwpW1iASRhJDT4mSkbdHONM7BZF-j8A2YVdprMWXgk1hk&gStoreCode=800) as a substitute, plus a sprinkle of [dried chives](https://www.coles.com.au/product/masterfoods-chives-chopped-7g-163650). My husband prefers his plain, with no extra toppings.

I love this recipe so much I’ll often double the portion and have it for lunch or even dinner.

### 2. Banana Pancakes

This recipe is based on the [Inspired Taste Pancake Recipe](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/24593/essential-pancake-recipe/), with our favorite toppings added.

**Ingredients:**

- 1.5 cups self-raising flour  
- 2 tablespoons sugar  
- A pinch of salt  
- 1.25 cups milk  
- 70g butter  
- 1 large egg  
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract  

**Toppings:**

- Peanut butter  
- Banana (sliced, best served cold from the fridge)  
- Cinnamon + hemp seeds (for me)  
- Honey (for my husband)  

Instead of making lots of small pancakes, I’ve found it much quicker to make a few large ones. This recipe yields 4 big pancakes—enough for two days of breakfast for the two of us. Each morning, we each have one pancake, topped with peanut butter, banana slices, and our favorite finishing touches.

**Tips:**  
The secret to good pancakes is cooking on low-medium heat. On our stove, setting it to 3 out of 6 works best. The first pancake is always the hardest—once the pan is “seasoned,” the rest are easy.

They’re best fresh off the pan, but if mornings are hectic (which they usually are), I make a batch ahead of time, freeze the extras, and reheat them in the microwave. Not quite the same, but still delicious.

### 3. Overnight Oats

Overnight oats are our reliable backup plan. They require minimal prep, and unlike avocado or banana-based recipes, you don’t need to worry about ingredients being perfectly ripe.

Interestingly, we each have our own version:

**Mine:**

- 5 tablespoons [toasted muesli with dried fruits and nuts](https://www.coles.com.au/product/carman's-muesli-toasted-classic-fruit-and-nut-500g-6920566)  
- 1/2 tablespoon chia seeds  
- Milk (just enough to cover)  
- Leave in the fridge overnight  
- In the morning: I let it sit out for a while so it’s not too cold  

**His:**

- 5 tablespoons rolled oats  
- Dried fruit (goji berries are his current favorite)  
- Nuts (usually walnut or cashew, depending on what we have)  
- 1/2 tablespoon chia seeds  
- Milk  
- In the morning: warmed up in the microwave
