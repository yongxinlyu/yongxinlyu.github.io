I’m currently writing the first manuscript of my PhD research. If you’ve been through this, you know how dauting it feels to translate years of hard work into a polished, publishable story. But what really caught me off guard wasn’t the writing – it was the figures.

For the past few years, I’ve been creating figures for group meetings and conference presentations. I thought I had a solid handle on it. My slides were clear, my plots made sense, and my supervisor even used them in seminar talks. But as I learned the hard way, creating figures for publication is a completely different beast.

As my supervisor puts it:
> “Figures in presentations are easy. People don’t have time to scrutinize them. But figures in a paper? Readers will come back to them over and over again, picking apart every detail. They need to be precise, packed with information, and crystal clear.”

### From Slides to Manuscripts: A Bumpy Ride
In our research group, we present our data in weekly meetings. The figures we show are built for slides: quick, clear, and functional. Once a project is deemed publication-worthy, we transition those slide figures into manuscript-ready versions. Sounds simple, right? Not so much.

It took me *three months* and ten full iterations to get my figures ready for my first draft of manuscript. Yes, *ten versions*! And this was after starting with presentation-ready figures that I thought were pretty good. Looking back, I wish I’d know a few things when I started – things that could have saved me a lot of time and frustration.

If you’re in a similar spot, here are some lessons I’ve learned about creating scientific figures for high-impact journals. Whether you’re just starting your PhD or struggling with a figure set like I was, I hope these tips will help.

### Lesson 1: Embrace Revision
When I started, I thought I could get my figures perfect on the first try. I’d stay up late, tweaking every line and label, trying to make everything flawless. Big mistake.

What I didn’t realize was that revision is not just inevitable—it’s the point. Figures evolve as your story becomes clearer, and many elements in your first draft will get thrown out or completely reworked. Instead of aiming for perfection upfront, focus on making a decent draft and getting feedback. It’s the revision that really bring a figure to life.

Now, instead of beating myself up over changes, I treat revisions as part of the process. Each round gets the figures closer to the final goal. It’s less stressful, and it works.

### Lesson 2: Choose the Right Tools
Here’s a confession: I used PowerPoint for making figures throughout my MPhil and my first year of my PhD. For *four years*, I didn’t even know the difference between vector and raster images. If that sounds like you, here’s your wake-up call: PowerPoint might be find for slides, but it’s not enough for high-impact journals.

Once I started using tools like Inkscape, everything changed. Inkscape allows you to create scalable vector graphics, which look professional and stay sharp at any size. It was a steep learning curve, but totally worth it.

That said, PowerPoint isn’t all bad, I still use it for quick prototyping because it’s fast and familiar. If I need to sketch out an idea, PowerPoint gets it done. But for final figures, I always switch to Inkscape. It’s a bit like moving from a tricycle to a race car—scary at first, but so much faster once you get the hang of it.

### Lesson 3: Plan for Publication from the Start
If I could go back to the start of my PhD, I’d do one thing differently: design every figure as if it’s going to be published. Even if it’s just for a group meeting, I’d like about the final manuscript format. That means: 
- Using vector-based tools like Inkscape or Illustrator.
- Choosing color schemes that are colourblind-friendly.
- Including clear, readable labels and legends.

Starting with publication-ready figures saves so much time later. Transitioning from PowerPoint slides to journal-quality figures was a painful process for me. But now that I’ve made the switch, I’m never going back.

### Final Thoughts
Creating scientific figures is an art—and like any art, it takes practice. Your first figures might be clunky, and your revisions may feel endless. But with the right tool, a wiliness to revise, and a bit of planning, you’ll get there.

And if you’re just starting out, take it from me: don’t wait until your first manuscript to start thinking about publication-quality figures. Your future self will thank you.
