As a PhD student in computational materials science, my MacBook is **my lab bench, my research assistant, and my primary source of frustration.** I spend **an unhealthy amount of time** staring at this screen, running simulations, analyzing data, and occasionally contemplating my life choices.

I’m still rocking a **MacBook Air with an M1 chip** that I bought in 2021 at the start of my PhD. It’s still holding up like a champ—except the storage is always on the verge of running out. Thankfully, I sync everything to OneDrive, which means I regularly purge my laptop like it’s spring cleaning day.

I’m hoping to upgrade after I finish this research project (because setting up a new Mac feels like moving to a new lab, and I’m not emotionally ready for that).

This blog is a tour of my digital lab—my MacBook—the apps I live in, and where I actually spend my time whenever I sit at my desk.

### 1. Coding & Data Analysis: Where the Magic (or Madness) Happens

My research relies heavily on simulations—which means **a LOT of coding, data analysis, and waiting for things to run.**

> “Some people write poetry. I write Python scripts that occasionally work.
> 

- **Terminal** – A portal to the **supercomputer** where I run my simulations. The macOS default app is simple, clean, and makes me feel like I’m hacking into NASA. (In reality, I’m just running jobs and waiting… a lot of waiting.)

- **VS Code** – My ultimate coding playground.  I live inside **Jupyter Notebooks** for scripting, data analysis, and figure plotting. I’ve tried many ways to host Jupyter but finally settled on VS Code—it has everything in one place. **Bonus:** You can keep **virtual pets** inside VS Code. Also, there’s a Bongo Cat that bongos when I type. 10/10 feature.

### 2. Scientific Visualization & Molecular Modeling

A big part of my research involves **turning raw data into visuals**—whether it’s molecules, crystal structures, or scientific figures.

- **Avogadro** – For visualizing and modifying organic molecular structures. 

- **VESTA** – Used exclusively for crystal structure visualization.

- **ChemDraw** – An absolute must-have for drawing and designing chemical structures.

- **Inkscape** – My go-to vector graphics tool for post-processing Python figures and creating publication-quality images.

- **Blender** – Currently learning this one for advanced 3D modeling. Will I master it? Unclear. But if I do, expect science-themed Pixar animations from me.

### 3. Writing & Document Preparation

PhD = **Endless Writing**. Papers, reports, thesis drafts, random notes that I swear I’ll organize later.

- **GoodNotes (on iPad)** – My **superpower during meetings**. I prefer handwritten notes, especially for supervisor meetings, because sometimes, in group meetings, **I panic and forget how to type**. I *tried* to switch to the Apple Notes app (because I heard people with high IQs use it) but gave up—GoodNotes just feels better for handwriting.

- **Microsoft Word** – Look, I know **LaTeX is the gold standard** for computational scientists, but let’s be real—I **still** draft most of my papers in Word. Sometimes, I transfer everything to Overleaf (LaTeX) later to pretend I’m a Real Computational Scientist™.

- **EndNote** – Manages my citations, references, and stops me from writing “(citation needed)” everywhere.

- **Preview** – The default macOS PDF viewer. Simple, fast, and doesn’t crash when I open a massive research paper.

### 4. Presentations & Communication

Presenting is a **huge** part of my PhD. And since I work remotely from my supervisor, every single meeting happens on my MacBook.

- **PowerPoint** – My primary tool for making  conference presentations, seminar slides, and research talks.

- **Microsoft Teams** – Our uni is in the Microsoft ecosystem, so most research meetings happen here. Occasionally, I use **Zoom** (Unpopular opinion: I actually *prefer Zoom*, because Teams won’t let you see both the chat and people’s faces while presenting. It *drives me crazy,* but I’ve *almost* gotten used to it.)

### Final Thoughts

This **isn’t just a laptop—it’s my research HQ**. A control center for everything from coding and citations to molecular modeling and caffeine-fueled late-night writing.
