When I first heard the word employability, I thought it simply meant getting a job. But after finishing my PhD and stepping into the job-hunting world, I realised it’s something far more complex and personal.

In today’s blog, I’d like to share my ongoing journey of understanding my own employability. I haven’t secured a job yet, so this post might sound a little uncertain or even negative at times. But that’s exactly where I am, figuring things out in real time.

### From a clear path to an open sea

One night, my husband and I were talking about how our career landscape have changed. Before the PhD, the path ahead felt like a road on solid ground: clear, predictable, and paved with milestones: bachelor’s, master’s, PhD. 

But once I reached the end of that road, it was as if the ground disappeared beneath my feet.

Now, I find myself sailing on an open sea with no marked routes, but only possibilities stretching endlessly in all directions. The world suddenly seemed full of options—postdocs, industries, government jobs, yet I didn’t know where to go or even how to start navigating.

### What is employability?

At first, I thought “employability” was just another buzzword universities use. But during the recent Employability Symposium attended at UNSW I had a lightbulb moment: this is the word I’ve been looking for all along.

According to Wikipedia, employability refers to the attributes of a person that make them able to gain and maintain employment,

A line from the symposium stuck with me even more: “To be employed is to be at risk; to be employable is to be secure.”

That’s when I realised employability isn’t about finding a job, but about understanding who I am, and the unique value I can bring to society. 

Ironically, this has been the most time-consuming and confusing part of my job-hunting journey — not sending out applications, not preparing for interviews, but trying to understand *myself*.

### The four parts of Employability

One framework that helped me think about this is the Japanese concept of **Ikigai** — the intersection of:

- what you love,
- what you’re good at, and
- what the world needs.
- and what you can be paid for

<div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog_figure/ikigai.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Towards the end of my PhD, I was overly optimistic and driven by curiosity. I loved the idea of *AI for biology and medicine* and thought it was exactly what the world needed. But when I started reading job ads, I realised I didn’t yet have the required skills— In fact, I couldn’t even understand many of the keywords. 

I was missing one key piece of the puzzle — *what I’m good at*.

That discovery was humbling but necessary.


### The Long process of translating myself

In the past few months, I’ve rewritten my CV coutless times, and each version represents a different version of myself tailored to the job description: data scientist, quantitative researcher, postdoc.

Job hunting has forced me to translate my academic experience into the language of industry. Every job ad became a mirror showing me what I had and what I lacked.

There were so many moments like:

- “Oh! I didn’t know I already have that skill!”
- and also, “I really wish I had learned that during my PhD…”

If I could go back, I would start learning to articulate my employability *during* my PhD — not just assume that a degree alone would naturally lead to a job.

### Turning Frustration into Visualisation

Well, as someone who loves data and visualisation, I couldn’t resist asking: *what does all this job-hunting data actually look like?*

How could I end this blog without a visualisation?

This was my first attempt at analysing text-based data — I used job descriptions as the input, extracted keywords, and projected them using PCA to map the *landscape* of positions I’ve applied for. Each point represents one job; together, they form a visual summary of my search so far.

{% endraw %}

I also made a small **Sankey diagram** showing the journey of my applications — from submission to outcome. As you might guess, most of the flows end in the *rejected* column. Reality is painful, but honestly, playing with these data was fun.

At first, I felt deeply frustrated, convinced my employability must be terrible because of the rejections. But when I looked at the actual numbers, I realised I had only sent out **ten applications** in total. Statistically speaking, I’m still in the *very early stage* of job hunting.

So — fingers crossed for the best! 

### Final thoughts

If you’re also in the middle of job hunting, I want to say this: I wouldn’t have known how challenging it is to find a job in Australia right now if I hadn’t gone through it myself.

But I’ve also realised this process is more than just career exploration — it’s a journey of *self-awareness*.

So take care of yourself. Be patient. Keep learning. It’s hard, but you’re not alone.

Hang in there — and hopefully, we’ll both see the light at the end of the tunnel soon.
