If I had to pick one beach in the world to keep returning to, it would be Coogee. Hands down, my all-time favourite. There’s something about it—maybe the mix of raw ocean energy and the tucked-away rock pools, or maybe just the feeling I get when I’m there. These days, I’ve been doing what I call “ocean therapy” at Coogee, and I want to share a little slice of that experience with you.

Ocean therapy, in its simplest form, is this: get into the water, head to toe. That’s it. No gear, no goals, no pressure. Just you and the ocean.

Unlike most people who flock to the beach in summer, I actually prefer going during the colder months. Yes, even in winter! The water usually sits between 18°C and 20°C, and the beach feels like it’s taken a deep breath—quiet, calm, and almost meditative without the summer crowds.

Some friends think I’m a bit mad. “Isn’t it freezing?” they ask. Well, yes. That’s the point. The cold jolts you awake in the best way. It’s like drinking an espresso for your whole body. Cold water makes me feel present and alive—it brings me out of my thoughts and straight into the moment.

Once I’m in, I don’t do much. A bit of gentle swimming, a little floating, and often just leaning on the edge of the rock pool, elbows resting on the seaweed-covered stones (they feel like a green velvet blanket), watching the waves crash beyond. It’s grounding and hypnotic in the best way.

One of my unexpected joys? Watching other people get into the cold water. Especially in winter. There’s a universal moment of hesitation, a deep breath, a burst of bravery—and then the cold hits. It’s hilarious and endearing to see everyone’s facial expressions. Over time, I’ve learned a key secret: *everyone* knows it’s cold, but the pros never scrunch up their faces. Keep cool, literally and figuratively.

### **The Great Aussie Towel Trick**

One cultural thing that really surprised me when I first moved to Australia was how casually people changed at the beach. Just a towel wrapped around the waist or chest, and somehow—like magic—they’re in dry clothes a minute later. Coming from an Asian background, this was wild to me. I’d shiver my way to the changing rooms rather than attempt this mysterious public towel dance.

But after a few years of observation and trial-and-error, I cracked the code. There’s no secret technique. The real barrier is in your head. All you need is a **big towel** and the belief that you *won’t* accidentally drop it. That’s it. Confidence is key!

### **My Favourite Rock Pools at Coogee**

I’m not a fan of being pounded by waves, so I usually skip the open ocean and stick to Coogee’s rock pools. There are three that I’ve tried, each with their own vibe:

- **The Ross Jones Rockpool** – This is my go-to when I want a quick solo swim. It’s sheltered, easy to get in and out of, and did I mention it’s free? Perfect for an impromptu ocean therapy session.
- **The McIver’s Ladies Baths** – When I’m out with my girlfriends, this is the one we pick. It’s women-only, tucked into the cliffside, and has a peaceful vibe. Bonus: there’s a hot shower. After a winter swim, that feels like a five-star luxury.
- **Wylie’s Baths** – This one’s a little more polished, with proper facilities, a working space, and even a café. Getting out of the cold water and into a hot coffee or chocolate? Absolute bliss.

### **Final Tips**

- **Check the conditions first** – [Wylie’s Baths](https://wylies.com.au) has a live cam you can check before heading out. The three rock pools have different levels of exposure to waves: Wylie’s gets hit the hardest, followed by the Ladies Baths, while the Ross Jones Rockpool is the most sheltered. Even when Wylie’s is closed due to rough seas, the Ross Jones Rockpool is usually calm enough.
- **Post-swim treats** – You’ve earned it! Grab a *Yo-Chi* like a true local (frozen yogurt + toppings = happiness), hit a nearby café for something hot, or wander into one of the many restaurants or pubs around. Coogee’s full of options.
