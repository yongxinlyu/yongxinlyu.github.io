Most of my research happens inside a computer — simulating, visualizing, and analyzing atomic structures that exist only on a screen. But I’ve always loved handcrafts and making things in the real world. There’s something deeply satisfying about *holding* a model of the structure I usually see as colorful atoms on my monitor.

During my PhD, I’ve been studying **perovskites** — a fascinating class of materials that appear everywhere from ceramics to solar cells. On the atomic scale, perovskites are built from repeating **octahedra** (eight-sided units) connected at their corners, forming a beautiful three-dimensional lattice.

Over the years, I’ve explored several ways to **bring this structure to life** — blending science and creativity. In this post, I’ll share **three hands-on ways** to build your own perovskite crystal model:

- **Origami** — fold your crystal lattice from paper
- **Knitting** — create a soft, large-scale version
- **3D printing** — design a durable, modular model for labs or demos

Each method highlights a different aspect of the structure — geometry, scale, or modularity — and all are fun, tactile ways to explore materials science.

### **1. Origami Perovskite**

**Difficulty:** ★☆☆ (Beginner)

**Materials:** Paper, thread

My first and simplest experiment was the origami perovskite. All you need is paper and a bit of patience.

Start by cutting paper into roughly a 3:1 rectangular shape and folding origami octahedra. You can follow this excellent
[step-by-step guide](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/origami-octahedron-instructions-2540641).

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog_figure/origami-perovskite-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>

Once you’ve made a few octahedra, connect them at the corners using thread, gently tie them together to form a cubic network. I love this model because it’s flexible. You can tilt the octahedra to mimic the rotations that solid-state physicist observe in real perovskites.

I originally made these to help visualize how octahedral tilts affect space group symmetry in perovskites. I used 30x10 cm rectangular paper, which makes the final model roughly **50 million times larger** than the atomic lattice!

This is also a fantastic outreach activity. During the “Science in the Swamps” event with School of Chemistry at UNSW, we invited primary school kids and their families to fold their own octahedra. It was a bit tricky for smaller hands (and even some parents), but everyone loved seeing their creations come together into something scientific. In fact, I think the parents enjoyed it even more than the kids!

You can find our outreach materials, including folding templates and a short intro to perovskites, here: [github link].

Another great variation comes from this [research-inspired project](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jaume-Roqueta/publication/266383933_Origami_of_petovskite_structure/links/542e966d0cf277d58e8ec28b/Origami-of-petovskite-structure.pdf). Their workflow is similar but they build each octahedron from six seperate square pieces. I’ll have to try this method next time!

### 2. Knitted Perovskite

**Difficulty:** ★★☆ (Intermediate)

**Materials:** Yarn, knitting needles or crochet hooks, cardboard

The next method takes perovskite modeling to a softer level — **knitting**!

The idea was inspired by a wonderful project from **the University of Surrey**, where researchers and knitters collaborated to create a **2-meter-high** knitted perovskite, now proudly displayed in their Department of Chemistry. 

Here are a few articles about that project:

[3](https://blogs.egu.eu/network/atomsi/2013/08/08/spinning-a-yarn-about-perovksite/)

For my version, I used **8-ply yarn** to knit triangles (you can also crochet them). Then, I sewed eight triangles together to form an octahedron. Since the yarn shapes are too soft to hold on their own, I cut matching triangle pieces from cardboard, taped them together into an octahedron, and inserted them inside as supports.

    </div>
</div>

This project is still ongoing. It’s time-consuming but incredibly fun. So far, I’ve made eight octahedra and plan to finish assembling them just in time for my graduation ceremony next month!

### **3. 3D-Printed Perovskite**

**Difficulty:** ★★★ (Advanced)

**Materials:** 3D printer, small magnetic balls, superglue

Finally, my most robust and visually striking version — the **3D-printed perovskite**.

This idea came from brainstorming with my cousin, [Zefang](), who’s an expert in 3D printing. I wanted a model that could be assembled and disassembled, rather than one fixed in place. 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog_figure/3d-print-perovskite-1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog_figure/3d-print-perovskite-2.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


The .stl files are avaliable here: []

When printing, it helps to orient one face flat on the bed for better stability. After printing, I added **5mm magnetic balls** at each corner, using superglue to secure them with their poles aligned along the axes. Be sure to alternate the poles—three corners with the north pole facing out and three with the south — so that the octahedra can connect without always repelling each other.

The result is a **modular perovskite kit** that can be arranged into 0D, 1D, 2D or full 3D structures. My office mates and I had great fun assembling different configurations during coffee breaks!

### Final Thoughts

Making these perovskite models has been one of the most rewarding part of my PhD journey. It's a reminder that science isn't only about code or equations. It can also be fun!

Whether you're an educator, a researcher, or simply curious about materials, I hope these ideas inspire you to build your own perovskite!
