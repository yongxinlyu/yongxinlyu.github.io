I’ve just finished my **third week of teaching**—and wow, what a journey it’s been already. I wanted to jot down some thoughts while they’re still fresh. If you’re brand new to teaching like me, maybe this reflection will help you feel a bit more prepared (or at least less alone!).

When I first walked into a classroom as a tutor, I kind of assumed good teaching just *happened*—that some people were just naturally great at it. Especially the extroverted types who love being in the spotlight. But after going through the *Beginning to Teach* program at UNSW, I realized something really important: **teaching isn’t just about being charismatic. It’s about being prepared—even when things don’t go as planned**.

### **Teaching Isn’t a Conference Talk**

One of the first big shifts I noticed was how different teaching is from giving a presentation. When I’m at a conference, I can walk through my slides however I like. If the audience follows—great. If not… well, that’s kind of on them.

But teaching? Teaching is *not* that. At UNSW, there’s a huge focus on **student-centered learning**, which was very different from how I learned during my undergrad in Hong Kong. It’s not just about covering the material—it’s about checking in constantly, making sure students are engaged and following along, and adjusting if they’re not.

I’ve learned that **engagement isn’t optional—it’s the job**.

### **Finding My Teaching Style (And Letting Go of Comparison)**

In the beginning, I really struggled with comparison. Some of my colleagues—especially those with language teaching experience—seemed so confident and smooth in front of a classroom. I remember thinking, *“How can I ever be that good?”* During my first week, I was honestly quite discouraged. I even felt a bit sorry for my students, thinking they might learn more from someone with more experience.

But here’s what I’ve come to realize: **I don’t need to teach like them. I need to teach like me.** And I *do* have my own strengths.

I’m still figuring out what my teaching style looks like, but I’ve started leaning into what works for me—and what works for my students. I’m not the kind of person who enjoys lecturing at the front of the room for an hour straight. But I *am* good at creating smaller, interactive moments that help students feel more comfortable and involved.

Plus, I’m still a student myself. I remember what it feels like to sit in those seats. I know what helps—and what doesn’t. And I have time and energy to really focus on supporting them.

### **Technology Is My Friend**

The first couple of tutorials were really quiet—and I mean *awkwardly* quiet. When I asked a question, sometimes no one responded. I used to worry that meant students weren’t engaged or interested.

 But I’ve learned that **quiet doesn’t mean disinterested**—some students just don’t feel comfortable speaking out loud yet.

That’s where tech comes in. Inspired by my friend’s online tutorials, I started using tools like **Kahoot**, **Slido**, and **Microsoft Forms**. They’re perfect for polls, check-ins, or anonymous questions. Students can engage by typing, which lowers the barrier and gets more people involved.

It’s honestly been a game-changer.

### **Tech Glitches**

Speaking of tech… oh boy. That first week? It took me *forever* to get set up. Logging into the computer, finding the right slides, connecting my MacBook to the projector—it was a mess. I think I spent nearly 20 minutes just figuring things out. 

Now? I’ve got it down to under 5 minutes.

Little wins!

One trick I use all the time now is the **“freeze screen”** button. It lets me freeze the slide on the projector while I check notes or prep something quietly. Super useful.

Also, **don’t be afraid to ask for help**. My teaching buddy Mariana was there for me during my first two weeks, and honestly, she saved my butt more than once.

### **Speaking Up: Voice and Confidence**

Another challenge: **my voice is pretty soft**. I found it scary to speak up in a big classroom at first, especially during those awkward first few minutes. But I’ve learned that once I get past the intro, it usually gets better.

One tip that’s helped: I use a **laser pointer** so I can walk around instead of standing still at the front. It helps me feel more relaxed and gets me closer to the students, which makes speaking easier.

Still working on this, but improving every week!

### **Time Management: Less is More**

I always plan *way* too much content. I get excited about all the things I want to cover… and then run out of time.

Now I’ve started thinking in terms of:

- What are the **essential activities** we *must* do?
- What’s **nice to have**, but skippable if needed?

This has helped me slow down and create more space for discussion, questions, and flexibility. Honestly, it feels better for everyone.

### **Final Reminders (For Me and Maybe for You Too)**

- **Bring water.** You’ll talk more than you think.
- **Relax before class.** Take a breath, center yourself, and remind yourself you’re doing your best.
- **It’s okay not to be perfect.** Every week is a chance to learn and grow.
