Hi! I am a computational materials scientist. I'm interested in exploring the chemical space of materials using `high-throughput` computational methods and interpretable `machine learning`. 

I completed my BSc and MPhil in Applied Physics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I explored two-dimensional materials using experimental and computational approaches in [Professor Jianhua Hao](https://ap.polyu.edu.hk/apjhhao/)'s group.

At UNSW, I'm part of [Professor Tom Wu](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/tom-wu)'s group. My research focuses on `inverse design` of 2D `perovskites` using machine learning and first-principles calculations.
