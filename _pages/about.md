Hi! I am a computational materials scientist with a PhD from UNSW Sydney. I'm passionate about using high-throughput atomistic simulations, data-driven methods, and interpretable machine learning to explore the vast chemical space of functional materials. 

At UNSW, I'm part of [Professor Tom Wu](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/tom-wu)'s group. My research focuses on `inverse design` of 2D `perovskites` using machine learning and first-principles calculations.

Previously, I completed my BSc and MPhil in Applied Physics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I explored `2D materials` using multiscale simulation methods in [Professor Jianhua Hao](https://ap.polyu.edu.hk/apjhhao/)'s group.
